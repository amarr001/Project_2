# Lodafones

# Overview

A web application designed to help users buy a new phone without paying outright and also keep their plans with a third party plan provider. There is a selection of features which the users can select and compare. 

# Usage

Upon loading of the web application it will display different phones available in store. The phones are organised in cards and each card holds information such as brand name, phone model, main features and price. The user can then select the product by clicking on the "View product" button which will then redirect them to the individual product page containing more detailed information. The user can also add the selected phone to their shopping cart either from the main page or from the individual product page. Upon clicking the "Add to cart" button the phone will be added to their shopping cart. When the user is ready to checkout they can click the checkout button, fill out their personal details and finalise payment.
